                  One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he
                  found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
                  He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
                  little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and
                  divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
                  able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His
                  many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest
                  of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened
                  to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper
                  human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
                  its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay
                  spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -
                  and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out
                  of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
                  It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
                  upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of
                  her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look
                  out the window at the dull weather. Drops
